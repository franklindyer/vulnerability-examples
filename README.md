This repo contains several small example applications with known vulnerabilities, meant for educational purposes.

These applications should not be deployed on the internet! These vulnerable applications should only be deployed locally for personal practice, or to a trusted group of people as a short-term CTF activity. This is because Docker containers are [not sufficient protection](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/199905/if-a-container-is-compromised-does-that-mean-host-also-compromised) against root access on the hosts running them.
