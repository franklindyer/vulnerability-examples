This repo contains several small example applications with known vulnerabilities, meant for educational purposes.

These applications should not be deployed on the internet! These vulnerable applications should only be deployed locally for personal practice, or to a trusted group of people as a short-term CTF activity. This is because Docker containers are [not sufficient protection](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/199905/if-a-container-is-compromised-does-that-mean-host-also-compromised) against root access on the hosts running them.

If an app directory contains a `Dockerfile`, you can build it using Docker. You should then run the Docker image using the `-p` option to make a port mapping between your machine and the Docker container. The application will usually run on port `5000`.
