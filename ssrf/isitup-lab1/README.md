To run this lab:

1. Build `app-templates/php-base` as `vulnerability-examples/php-base`.
2. Run `docker compose up`.

This will simulate a machine on your local network at `10.9.0.2` which is serving a simple web page that allows you to check whether a given website is up or down, and view its raw HTML. It also has a private file server running on localhost port `8000`. One of the files being served contains a poem. Can you figure out how to view this private file?
