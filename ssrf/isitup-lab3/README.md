To run this lab:

1. Build `app-templates/php-base` as `vulnerability-examples/php-base`.
2. Run `docker compose up`.

This will simulate a machine on your local network at `10.9.0.2` which is serving a simple web page that allows you to check whether a given website is up or down, and view its raw HTML. 

There is another machine at `10.9.0.3` running a file server on port `8000`, but it doesn't accept traffic from anyone other than `10.9.0.3`. If you try viewing its file server yourself, you won't be able to do so. Can you figure out a way to view a private file containing a poem on `10.9.0.3`?
