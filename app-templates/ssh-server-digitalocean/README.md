This directory contains some scripts that can be used to privately host (through DigitalOcean) an SSH server that is vulnerable to brute-force attacks. Of course, it can be modified to poorly configure SSH servers in other ways, or other potentially vulnerable services. The workflow is as follows:
- Spin up two DigitalOcean droplets.
- Create a VPC network.
- Disable all public interfaces of one of the droplets. This will be the vulnerable server.
- The vulnerable-to-be server is now only accessible from your personal droplets. SSH into the other server, which is still public-facing.
- Run `./setup <name-of-that-droplet>` from the public-facing server.
For this little demo, the `setup` script performs the following actions:
- Take a snapshot of the vulnerable-to-be server so that it can be reverted to its original state after the exericse.
- Generate a list of usernames and crappy passwords.
- Copy the crappy usernames and passwords as well as a configuration script to the vulnerable-to-be server.
- Run the "misconfiguration" script. This will turn on SSH password authentication, and create user accounts with the usernames and passwords generated.
- Delete the username and password files.
Now you can try launching a brute-force SSH attack to steal some of these accounts! When you're done, you can revert the vulnerable droplet to its original state using the snapshot taken by `setup` and the command-line utility `doctl` for managing droplets.

FYI, running vulnerable applications on DigitalOcean droplets *should not violate their [acceptable use policy](https://www.digitalocean.com/legal/acceptable-use-policy)* as long as these droplets are not publicly accessible, and aren't consuming too many resources. I was unsure about this after reading their AUP so I filed a support ticket to make sure. Here's the response I received:

```
Greetings from DigitalOcean Support!

Apologies for the delayed response. We are seeing an increase in ticket traffic and this is causing some delays to ticket responses. Our team is actively working towards improving the response time and address the concerns as quickly as they can. 

We understand your concerns and are more than happy to address them. We would like to inform you that this type of testing is generally ok as long as it's not detrimental to service in terms of negatively affecting others on the platform / your hypervisor. Our Security team at that point will take action on that Droplet or if the pattern repeats the account.

This would include reasons like, but is not limited to: large bandwidth usage, CPU resource usage, etc. originating from or sending to a Droplet.

Our Security Operations team would always try to be transparent with communication if the above scenarios ever did occur. You would get a ticket asking for more details on what you were doing + to stop the negative effects. If you could spread the tests across several Droplets in various regions, that may help to reduce the load for one hypervisor in particular.

You can read our Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy here to ensure no other issues from your use-case will alert our Security Operations team:

For any additional questions please reach out to privacy@digitalocean.com and our security team will be happy to answer them. Please note our security team is only available Monday-Friday US business hours.  

Please feel free to reach out to us if you have any additional queries. Weâ€™re always here for you!
