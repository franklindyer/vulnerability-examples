This directory contains several versions of a simple login app.

An instance of this app consists of four pieces:  
1. A class that handles user creations and login attempts.  
2. A class used by the above to interface with a DBMS.  
3. A Flask server script that uses the two above classes to handle state.  
4. A rebuild script that generates sample users and passwords.  

Within a Docker container, the project structure is as follows:
```
data
╚═ app
   ╠═ server.py
   ╠═ rebuild.py
   ╠═ selectedLoginApp.py
   ╚═ selectedDatabaseManager.py
```
This structure is necessary to keep different versions of (1), (2), (3) and (4) interoperable with each other so that we can take advantage of that yummy combinatorial goodness by mixing and matching.

The `Dockerfile` in the main directory is for building a safe, "vanilla" version of the app. In the `variants` folder you will find versions of the app with varying vulnerabilities. These include:
- `Dockerfile-lab1`: vulnerable to SQL injection (sqlite) with verbose error messages
- `Dockerfile-lab2`: vulnerable to brute-force attacks with weak usernames and passwords (TODO)
