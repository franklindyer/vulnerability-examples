Run this application using

`docker run -p <your-port>:5000 frpzzd/toy-payment-platform`

or you can run it with your own local build of this application, using the `Dockerfile` in this directory. Upon running, the build script will print out three usernames and passwords for you to use however you like. If you're able to gain any money, login as other users, or view other users' balances or payments, that is considered a vulnerability.

I've tried to make this application "truly secure", but I wouldn't be surprised if I've overlooked a few things and there's a hole that hasn't occurred to me. You can find additional information in the file `specs.txt`, which lists all user inputs and actions on the website, and `tests.txt`, which has a short list of tests that you can perform on the website, as well as a list of known security *weaknesses* (that as far as I know cannot be turned into full-on exploits).
