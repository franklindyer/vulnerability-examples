Here are some tests that should be performed on this application:
- Login form is not vulnerable to SQL injection
- Payment form is not vulnerable to SQL injection
- Session cookie is not vulnerable to SQL injection
- No server-side error messages should be dumped to the user
- It should not be possible to pay incorrect amounts, such as:
    - Negative numbers
    - Increments of less than $0.05
    - Amounts over 1000
    - Amounts greater than the balance
- It should not be possible to view other users' balances or transactions
- It should not be possible to create money via race conditions

Here are some known weaknesses that are part of this demo application:
- The session cookie never expires
- Server-side passwords and session cookies are not salted + hashed
