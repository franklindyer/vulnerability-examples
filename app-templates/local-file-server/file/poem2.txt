'Twas summer, and the sun had mounted high: 
Southward the landscape indistinctly glared 
Through a pale steam; but all the northern downs, 
In clearest air ascending, showed far off 
A surface dappled o'er with shadows flung 
From brooding clouds; shadows that lay in spots 
Determined and unmoved, with steady beams 
Of bright and pleasant sunshine interposed; 
To him most pleasant who on soft cool moss 
Extends his careless limbs along the front 
Of some huge cave, whose rocky ceiling casts 
A twilight of its own, an ample shade, 
Where the wren warbles, while the dreaming man, 
Half conscious of the soothing melody, 
With side-long eye looks out upon the scene, 
By power of that impending covert, thrown 
To finer distance. Mine was at that hour 
Far other lot, yet with good hope that soon 
Under a shade as grateful I should find 
Rest, and be welcomed there to livelier joy. 
Across a bare wide Common I was toiling 
With languid steps that by the slippery turf 
Were baffled; nor could my weak arm disperse 
The host of insects gathering round my face, 
And ever with me as I paced along. 

Upon that open moorland stood a grove, 
The wished-for port to which my course was bound. 
Thither I came, and there, amid the gloom 
Spread by a brotherhood of lofty elms, 
Appeared a roofless Hut; four naked walls 
That stared upon each other!--I looked round, 
And to my wish and to my hope espied 
The Friend I sought; a Man of reverend age, 
But stout and hale, for travel unimpaired. 
There was he seen upon the cottage-bench, 
Recumbent in the shade, as if asleep; 
An iron-pointed staff lay at his side. 

Among the hills of Athol he was born; 
Where, on a small hereditary farm, 
An unproductive slip of rugged ground, 
His Parents, with their numerous offspring, dwelt; 
A virtuous household, though exceeding poor! 
Pure livers were they all, austere and grave, 
And fearing God; the very children taught 
Stern self-respect, a reverence for God's word, 
And an habitual piety, maintained 
With strictness scarcely known on English ground. 

From his sixth year, the Boy of whom I speak, 
In summer, tended cattle on the hills; 
But, through the inclement and the perilous days 
Of long-continuing winter, he repaired, 
Equipped with satchel, to a school, that stood 
Sole building on a mountain's dreary edge, 
Remote from view of city spire, or sound 
Of minster clock! From that bleak tenement 
He, many an evening, to his distant home 
In solitude returning, saw the hills 
Grow larger in the darkness; all alone 
Beheld the stars come out above his head, 
And travelled through the wood, with no one near 
To whom he might confess the things he saw. 

So the foundations of his mind were laid. 
In such communion, not from terror free, 
While yet a child, and long before his time, 
Had he perceived the presence and the power 
Of greatness; and deep feelings had impressed 
So vividly great objects that they lay 
Upon his mind like substances, whose presence 
Perplexed the bodily sense. He had received 
A precious gift; for, as he grew in years, 
With these impressions would he still compare 
All his remembrances, thoughts, shapes, and forms; 
And, being still unsatisfied with aught 
Of dimmer character, he thence attained 
An active power to fasten images 
Upon his brain; and on their pictured lines 
Intensely brooded, even till they acquired 
The liveliness of dreams. Nor did he fail, 
While yet a child, with a child's eagerness 
Incessantly to turn his ear and eye 
On all things which the moving seasons brought 
To feed such appetite--nor this alone 
Appeased his yearning:--in the after-day 
Of boyhood, many an hour in caves forlorn, 
And 'mid the hollow depths of naked crags 
He sate, and even in their fixed lineaments, 
Or from the power of a peculiar eye, 
Or by creative feeling overborne, 
Or by predominance of thought oppressed, 
Even in their fixed and steady lineaments 
He traced an ebbing and a flowing mind, 
Expression ever varying! 
Thus informed, 
He had small need of books; for many a tale 
Traditionary round the mountains hung, 
And many a legend, peopling the dark woods, 
Nourished Imagination in her growth, 
And gave the Mind that apprehensive power 
By which she is made quick to recognise 
The moral properties and scope of things. 
But eagerly he read, and read again, 
Whate'er the minister's old shelf supplied; 
The life and death of martyrs, who sustained, 
With will inflexible, those fearful pangs 
Triumphantly displayed in records left 
Of persecution,and the Covenant--times 
Whose echo rings through Scotland to this hour! 
And there, by lucky hap, had been preserved 
A straggling volume, torn and incomplete, 
That left half-told the preternatural tale, 
Romance of giants, chronicle of fiends, 
Profuse in garniture of wooden cuts 
Strange and uncouth; dire faces, figures dire, 
Sharp-kneed, sharp-elbowed, and lean-ankled too, 
With long and ghostly shanks--forms which once seen 
Could never be forgotten! 
In his heart, 
Where Fear sate thus, a cherished visitant, 
Was wanting yet the pure delight of love 
By sound diffused, or by the breathing air, 
Or by the silent looks of happy things, 
Or flowing from the universal face 
Of earth and sky. But he had felt the power 
Of Nature, and already was prepared, 
By his intense conceptions, to receive 
Deeply the lesson deep of love which he, 
Whom Nature, by whatever means, has taught 
To feel intensely, cannot but receive. 

Such was the Boy--but for the growing Youth 
What soul was his, when, from the naked top 
Of some bold headland, he beheld the sun 
Rise up, and bathe the world in light! He looked-- 
Ocean and earth, the solid frame of earth 
And ocean's liquid mass, in gladness lay 
Beneath him:--Far and wide the clouds were touched, 
And in their silent faces could he read 
Unutterable love. Sound needed none, 
Nor any voice of joy; his spirit drank 
The spectacle: sensation, soul, and form, 
All melted into him; they swallowed up 
His animal being; in them did he live, 
And by them did he live; they were his life. 
In such access of mind, in such high hour 
Of visitation from the living God, 
Thought was not; in enjoyment it expired. 
No thanks he breathed, he proffered no request; 
Rapt into still communion that transcends 
The imperfect offices of prayer and praise, 
His mind was a thanksgiving to the power 
That made him; it was blessedness and love! 

A Herdsman on the lonely mountain-tops, 
Such intercourse was his, and in this sort 
Was his existence oftentimes possessed. 
O then how beautiful, how bright, appeared 
The written promise! Early had he learned 
To reverence the volume that displays 
The mystery, the life which cannot die; 
But in the mountains did he feel his faith. 
All things, responsive to the writing, there 
Breathed immortality, revolving life, 
And greatness still revolving; infinite: 
There littleness was not; the least of things 
Seemed infinite; and there his spirit shaped 
Her prospects, nor did he believe,--he saw. 
What wonder if his being thus became 
Sublime and comprehensive! Low desires, 
Low thoughts had there no place; yet was his heart 
Lowly; for he was meek in gratitude, 
Oft as he called those ecstasies to mind, 
And whence they flowed; and from them he acquired 
Wisdom, which works thro' patience; thence he learned 
In oft-recurring hours of sober thought 
To look on Nature with a humble heart, 
Self-questioned where it did not understand, 
And with a superstitious eye of love. 

From his native hills 
He wandered far; much did he see of men, 
Their manners, their enjoyments, and pursuits, 
Their passions and their feelings; chiefly those 
Essential and eternal in the heart, 
That, 'mid the simpler forms of rural life, 
Exist more simple in their elements, 
And speak a plainer language. In the woods, 
A lone Enthusiast, and among the fields, 
Itinerant in this labour, he had passed 
The better portion of his time; and there 
Spontaneously had his affections thriven 
Amid the bounties of the year, the peace 
And liberty of nature; there he kept 
In solitude and solitary thought 
His mind in a just equipoise of love. 
Serene it was, unclouded by the cares 
Of ordinary life; unvexed, unwarped 
By partial bondage. In his steady course, 
No piteous revolutions had he felt, 
No wild varieties of joy and grief. 
Unoccupied by sorrow of its own, 
His heart lay open; and, by nature tuned 
And constant disposition of his thoughts 
To sympathy with man, he was alive 
To all that was enjoyed where'er he went, 
And all that was endured; for, in himself 
Happy, and quiet in his cheerfulness, 
He had no painful pressure from without 
That made him turn aside from wretchedness 
With coward fears. He could afford to suffer 
With those whom he saw suffer. Hence it came 
That in our best experience he was rich, 
And in the wisdom of our daily life. 
For hence, minutely, in his various rounds, 
He had observed the progress and decay 
Of many minds, of minds and bodies too; 
The history of many families; 
How they had prospered; how they were o'er-thrown 
By passion or mischance, or such misrule 
Among the unthinking masters of the earth 
As makes the nations groan.
