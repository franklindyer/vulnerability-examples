This application implements a simple login form. The usernames and passwords of existing users are generated randomly.

It's vulnerable to SQL injection. See if you can figure out how to accomplish each of the following:
- Log in as some user
- Log in as an arbitrary user given their username
- Get a list of usernames
- Get a list of passwords
- Delete the users table (do this last!)
