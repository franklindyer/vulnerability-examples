Run this application using

`docker run -p <your-port>:5000 frpzzd/toy-payment-platform`

or you can run it with your own local build of this application, using the `Dockerfile` in this directory. Upon running, the build script will print out one username and password for you to use as you wish.

There's a SQL injection vulnerability hidden in this app. Can you figure out where? Which of the following are you able to accomplish?
- Viewing sensitive information from another user
- Transferring money on the behalf of another user
- Viewing the password of another user
- Directly modifying users' balances in the SQL database
- Exfiltrating the database contents directly
- Destroying database records
After you've done as much as you think is possible, look at the source code. Can you see why some of these would be possible, while others wouldn't? The security of this app is not as lax as the first SQL injection example.
