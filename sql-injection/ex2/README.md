This application is a simple payment platform allowing users to log in and make payments to other users from their balance. When you run the app, usernames and passwords of existing users will be randomly generated, and you'll be given an account to use for yourself.

There's a SQL injection vulnerability hidden in this app. Can you figure out where? Which of the following are you able to accomplish?
- Viewing sensitive information from another user
- Transferring money on the behalf of another user
- Viewing the password of another user
- Directly modifying users' balances in the SQL database
- Exfiltrating the database contents directly
- Destroying database records
After you've done as much as you think is possible, look at the source code. Can you see why some of these would be possible, while others wouldn't? The security of this app is not as lax as the first SQL injection example.

You can build a Docker image of this app by running

```docker build -t <your-username>/sql-inection-ex2 .```

and run the docker image on a specific port with

`docker run -p <your-port>:5000 <your-username>/toy-payment-platform`
