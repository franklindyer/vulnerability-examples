You can build the app by running

```docker build -t <your-username>/sql-injection-ex3``` .

and run your built Docker image as follows:

```docker run -p <your-port>:5000 <your-username>/sql-inection-ex3```

This app is also vulnerable to SQL injection, and you can steal or vandalize just about whatever you want from its database. However, a small trick is necessary. Try testing out some "naughty strings" on the login inputs.
