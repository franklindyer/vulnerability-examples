To run this lab:

1. Build `app-templates/ssh-server-docker` as `vulnerability-examples/ssh-server`.
2. Run `docker compose up`.

This will simulate a machine on your local network at `10.9.0.2` with SSH running and several accounts with weak usernames and passwords. Try to break in to one of them. Using `hydra` is suggested.
