This is a collection of unsafe nginx config files. Here's how to set up this demo:
1. Spin up a machine with `nginx`. (Could be a simple Docker container.)
2. Copy all of the config files that you're interested in to the folder `/etc/nginx/sites-available`.
3. Hard-link whichever config file you'd like to try into `sites-enabled` by running `ln /etc/nginx/sites-available/<your-config> /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/<your-config>`.
4. Run `sudo service nginx reload`.
5. When you're done, remove your hard link from `sites-enabled` and then return to step 3.

The following is common to all configurations:
- The app is (or was...) publicly served at `/app/`
- The app is locally served at `localhost:5000`
- The app has a public homepage at `index` and a private admin page at `admin`

The `nginx.conf` config files found in `conf_files/` have the following vulnerabilities:
- `bad_root`: exposes everything in `/etc/nginx`.
- `unsafe_var`: allows reflected XSS, header injection and open redirect
